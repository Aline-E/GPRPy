GPRPy main GUI

* TODO [#A] Make picking of coordinates possible
* TODO [#B] add filtering: high cut
* TODO [#A] Allow export of vtk files (choose thickness)
* DONE [#B] Improve performance through optimal use of numpy instead of for loops
* DONE [#A] Add AGC. Button and gprpytool are already there
* DONE [#A] Make Button to set depth/elevation plots 1:1 aspect ratio
* DONE [#A] Add topo correct: Load two files: one with x,y,z or x,z coordinates, one with corresponding profile points
* DONE [#A] Allow to set range of image x and y: Maybe just a button or two instead of the field
* DONE [#A] Implement dzt files: IN PROGESS
* DONE [#A] Display cursor coordinates on canvas
* DONE [#A] make help available for buttons when mouse-over 
* DONE [#A] make logo and put it into splash screen
* DONE [#B] Allow plotting of hyperbola to test velocity
* DONE [#A] Test plotting and printing both regular and GUI
* DONE [#A] Put dewow before time-zero adjust
* DONE [#A] Add AGC and TPOW gain. Put the buttons next to each other, make all other buttons two column span
* DONE [#A] Organize .py files such that only gprpy, gprpyGUI are in the main folder and the others are in a subfolder
* DONE [#A] Change such that print with depth now shows meters as unit
* DONE [#A] Make y-range double only (similar to input in dewow)
* DONE [#A] Make contrast double only (similar to input in dewow)
* DONE [#A] In history, when printing, add y-range/contrast into history string
* DONE [#A] Add todepth: Need to provide velocity
* DONE [#A] make fast dewow for large windows
* DONE [#A] make fast rem avg trace for large ntraces
