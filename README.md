To install python, either check out https://www.anaconda.com/download/
or https://www.python.org/

#### Requires:

numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pickle, tkinter, struct, re, tqdm, Pmw, pyevtk

Of these, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pickle, tkinter, struct, and re often come preinstalled. 

You can install missing packages (perhaps tqdm and Pmw) by running

`pip install tqdm Pmw pyevtk`

or

`pip3 install tqdm Pmw pyevtk`

or 

`conda install tqdm Pmw pyevtk`

If pip or conda can't find a specific package (for example pickle), then it may already be installed.

#### To run the GUI:

`python gprpyGUI.py`

or

`python3 gprpyGUI.py`
